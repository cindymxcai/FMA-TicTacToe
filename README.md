# FMA-TicTacToe

This is a command line Tic Tac Toe game for MYOB's Future Makers Academy application. 
The program used Java and JUnit for testing on Netbeans IDE 8.2


### Launch
To run this project, execute the main method in the Program class from your IDE.
<Br>
Tests can be found in the test folder.

### Assumptions made 
-The brief did not show a "play again" option so I have not included this. This is assuming that by "Players take turn to play till a player wins, or the end of the game (whichever happens first)." this means the program stops.

-I have chosen to use Test Driven Development
